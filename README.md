This repository contains a Java project demonstrating object-oriented programming principles, inheritance, and polymorphism in the context of 
managing different types of cars. The project includes abstract classes (Vehicle) representing generic vehicle characteristics, concrete subclasses 
(Car, ElectricCar) representing specific types of cars, and an interface (Drivable) defining common behaviors for drivable vehicles. Each class features method overloading, access modifiers, and method overriding as per the assignment requirements. The Main class serves as the entry point for running sample scenarios. Additionally, the repository includes a UML class diagram visualizing the project's class structure.
